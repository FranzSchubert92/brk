John and his friend Jack both like to swim, but rarely at the same time. Every 
third day, Jack will swim in the pool alone. When Jack isnâ€™t swimming, John 
will swim in the pool alone. However, every 50th day, both boys will swim in 
the same pool. Write some pseudocode that loops through 365 days, and outputs 
who is swimming on each day starting at day 1.
